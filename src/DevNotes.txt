# Implement a terrain

# Implement point lights that move around the scene with constant transforms

#############
Make a system for the movement where when regular running for four seconds it enables a boolean that will allow you to activate sprint 2 which shunts you forward in a burst of speed and momuntum 
.. Give cooldown


Instancing: If you have multiple instances of the same mesh, you can use instanced rendering (glDrawElementsInstanced) to draw all instances in one go, while applying different transformations for each instance.
Batching: Group objects that share the same shaders and materials to minimize state changes, and render them in batches for optimal performance.
Performance Gains
By minimizing the number of VAOs, VBOs, and draw calls, you can achieve significant performance improvements, especially when rendering complex scenes with multiple objects.
